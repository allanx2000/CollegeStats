Basically started something **similar to PayScale** ... but didn't know it at the time...

Spent 2-3 weeks learning **Jade, Node, Express, and Bootstrap** though so this just showcases some stuff I learned and did.

Also maybe some useful code snippets. I guess will extract those in Gists but if anyone is getting started and looking for some examples... this may have some, specifically:

- Sequalize
- Sessions
- Query Strings
- Helper classes (module.exports...)
- Forms and input extraction
